/**
  Write 3 classes. These classes can reside in the same file for ease and clarity.
  The first class (the controller) should have at least two methods, one of which being a main method.
  The main method needs to utilize constructors to create at least two separate objects. Each class must
  have at least 3 variables all 3 variables in each class must be used and set. Think about the Vehicle
  objects we have discussed in class. A vehicle has a make, model, MPG, 2/4 doors, color etc. Do not use a
  Vehicle object in this exercise :)

  Be creative. Have some fun. Using Java objects you can model just about anything you want. Cars, animals, poker games,
  sports teams, trees, beers, people and so on.
