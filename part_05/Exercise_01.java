/**
 * Write three classes. The Class_01 should contain the main method. The main method should create an instance
 * of Class_02. Class_02 must have several private instance variables. Use Class_01 to set the variables in Class_02.
 * Within Class_02, create an instance of Class_03, which must also have several private variables. Use Class_02 to set
 * the private variables within Class_03. Please note, do not use the constructor of any of these classes to set the
 * private instance variables. Use System.out.println at various points to demonstrate the flow of execution and
 * the varying state of each private variable. You may name these classes whatever you like.
