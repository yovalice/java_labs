/**
 * Write two classes. Class_01 should have the main(). Class_02 must have 3 or more private variables. Class_02 must
 * also have at least 3 overloaded constructors. In Class_01.main() create several instances of Class_02 using each
 * overloaded constructor. Each constructor should do something slightly differently. Class_02 must have at least
 * two private instance variables. Using the various instances of Class_02 that you now have in Class_01, call a method
 * within each instance of Class_02 to modify Class_02's private instance variables.
