/**
 * Write two classes. In Class_01 (which contains the main()) create an instance of Class_02 and pass that instance
 * to a method_01 within Class_01. Within method_01 you ust manipulate several private instance variables within
 * Class_02. Then, from within method_01, pass the instance of Class_02 to a new method, method_02. Within method_02
 * modify the instance variables of Class_02 once again. Use System.out.println at various points to demonstrate the
 * flow of execution and the varying state of each private variable. You can name these classes whatever you want.
