Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?

    A collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

    string cats[] = new string[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?

    Is a array of an array of arrays.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

    int scores[] = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

    string dogs = new string[10];

    int i;

    for(i= 0; i < 10; i++)
        sample[i] = i;

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

    Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index.
    The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.



8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

9) What is a bubble sort?

    Sort arrays.

10) How does a bubble sort work?

    It uses the repeated comparision and, if necessary, exchange of adjacent elements in the array.

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

    int cars[][] = new int {1, 2, 3, 4}{5, 6, 7}{8, 10}

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

    for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

14) What is a queue?

    Is like a list where the first one to enter is the first one to get out. Get priority.

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?



16) What is a stack?

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.

21) What is a String?

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
