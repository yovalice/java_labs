Create the following:

1) Write one super class with at least 3 private instance variables and at least 3 public methods
2) Write three subclasses (with at least 3 methods each that not getters and setters) that extend the super
class. Make sure each subclass can manipulate the private variables in the super class. One subclass should
extend another subclass which extends the super class. Each subclass should only have variables and methods
that apply to that subclass, ie Animal -> Mammal -> Whale.
3) Make use of the keyword "super" in at least two constructors.
4) Write an interface with at least 3 methods. Have the superclass implement this interface.
