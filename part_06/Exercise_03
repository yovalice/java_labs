Building on the previous examples. Add constructors to each class. Also, if you haven't already, build out
the inheritance hierarchy at least three tiers. For instance, Class_03 extends Class_02 and Class_02 extends
Class_01. Use private instance variables in each class. Use constructors in each class. Be sure that Class_03
can set and modify variables in Class_01.
